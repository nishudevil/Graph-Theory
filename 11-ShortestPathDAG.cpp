//Do topo sort
//Take nodes out of above stack and relax edges -> declare distance array and mark it as infinity; for source node it will be 0
//pop the first element -> check the adj node pair<int,int> -> calc its distance from src which (0+pair.second) and update the dist vector
//do it for all elements in stack and update with min value => distance vector is the shortest path for src

//I believe this is for indegree(src)=0 and src must be able to reach all nodes 
//There is no one before the first element in topo, so intial node is st.top() = src has no indegree
//moved acc to reachability, go to the node first that you can reach, minimize the no. of steps O(N+M) => works only when previous nodes in topo have been computed
//Finding the shortest/longest path to a vertex is easy if you already know the shortest/longest path to all the vertices that can precede it.
//Djikstra is necessary for cyclic graphs as topo cant be done
